    <p>The division of the sky into various regions, each represented by a constellation, has facilitated the study and observation of the multitude of stars. It's challenging to pinpoint exactly when humans first conceived the concept of constellations, as this astronomical knowledge predates recorded history. The names of constellations likely originated from early seafaring sailors. The origins of constellations in different civilizations may vary significantly, but with the expansion and mutual influence of various civilizations, the cultural aspects of constellations have undergone a process of amalgamation.</p>
    <p>The origin and development of constellations constitute a long and fascinating history in astronomy. The modern standardized constellation system primarily evolved from constellations developed by ancient civilizations such as Babylonian, Greek, and Roman civilizations.</p>

      <h2>Ancient</h2>
      <p>Western astrology originated in ancient Babylon, one of the four great civilizations. It is said that the so-called zodiac with its 12 constellations had over 20 constellation names in total, dating back to around 5000 years ago in Mesopotamia. Subsequently, the ancient Babylonians continued to divide the sky into many regions, proposing new constellations. By around 1000 BCE, they had proposed 30 constellations. Greek astronomers supplemented and developed Babylonian constellations, compiling the Greek constellation catalog. In the 2nd century CE, the Greek astronomer Ptolemy synthesized the astronomical achievements of his time, compiling 48 constellations. He connected the brightest stars within constellations with imaginary lines, envisioning them as the shapes of animals or figures, and combined them with mythological stories to give them suitable names, thus the origin of constellation names. Most of the 48 constellations from Greek mythology are situated in the northern sky and along the celestial equator.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Western</h2>
      <p>In 270 BCE, the Greek poet Aratus mentioned 47 constellations in his work "Phaenomena." From the descriptions of star regions in "Phaenomena," it is deduced that due to the precession of the equinoxes, the South Celestial Pole mentioned in the book does not align with the current South Celestial Pole. This suggests that the recorded sky in the book corresponds to around 2000 BCE. Additionally, the blank areas in the recorded sky indicate that the observer was likely located near 35° to 36° north latitude. Therefore, some argue that the practice of dividing the sky into constellations originated from Mesopotamia's Babylonian and Sumerian periods, with Greek and Egyptian constellations possibly being derived from that region.</p>
      <p>In the Book of Job, several constellations such as Ursa Major and Orion are mentioned. In the 12th century BCE during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar I, images of Sagittarius, Scorpius, and Hydra were carved on boundary stones. The works of ancient Greek poets Homer and Hesiod also refer to constellations like Ursa Major, Orion, and the Pleiades. Meanwhile, during the same period, Babylon had already recorded the twelve zodiac constellations in cuneiform script.</p>
      <p>By the 2nd century CE, Ptolemy recorded 1022 stars within the 48 constellations in his "Almagest," which served as the prototype for modern constellations. Subsequently, many astronomers filled the gaps between Ptolemy's constellations with new ones. In 1603, Bayer named constellations in the southern sky, followed by Lacaille in 1752 and Hevelius in 1690, who named constellations over the course of two centuries.</p>

      <h2>Naming of Ancient Constellations</h2>
      <p>The naming of ancient constellations varied across different cultures due to the relative isolation of ancient civilizations. In each culture, the patterns formed by stars were interpreted differently. For example, the Big Dipper in ancient Greece was seen as the tail of a bear; in China, it was viewed as a ladle for scooping liquids; the British saw it as a plough for farming; in southern France, it was considered a frying pan; the Pawnee Native Americans thought of it as a stretcher with a patient; the Maya believed it represented seven macaws; in India, it was seen as seven sages; and the Romans interpreted it as seven oxen.</p>
      <p>The ancient Chinese system of celestial offices reflects the social hierarchy of human society. The names of celestial offices are derived from various aspects of imperial court officials, palaces, temples, military camps, chariots, farming, hunting, and more. This reflects the Chinese ancient cultural concept of "correspondence between heaven and earth" and the idea of "unity between heaven and humanity."</p>
      <p>In the Western constellation system, the names of constellations mostly originate from characters and animals in Greek mythology. However, for the regions near the South Pole that are not visible from mainland Greece, Johann Bayer named them using terms associated with the sea and marine creatures. Later, the French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille named 13 dimmer constellations after scientific instruments and devices.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Naming of Modern Constellations</h2>
      <p>Modern constellations commonly include 14 human figures, 9 birds, 2 insects, 19 land animals, 10 aquatic creatures, 2 centaurs, and 29 inanimate objects; each representing a diverse range of symbols such as hair, serpents, dragons, winged horses, and rivers.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Naming of Stars</h2>
      <p>In academic circles, there isn't a single standardized system for naming stars. Brighter stars are typically named based on their constellation using either the Bayer designation or the Flamsteed designation. For example, Alpha Centauri (Bayer designation) in the constellation of Centaurus, or 61 Cygni (Flamsteed designation) in the constellation of Cygnus. Some stars are named using variable star designations, such as RR Lyrae in the constellation of Lyra.</p>
      <p>For stars that are not visible to the naked eye, they are generally not named according to their constellation unless they are part of a binary or multiple star system with a brighter star. These stars, which require a telescope to observe, are typically designated by their catalog numbers in specific star catalogs.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Naming of Deep Space Objects(DSOs)</h2>
      <p>Although DSOs (nebulae, star clusters, galaxies) rotate along with the celestial sphere, they are not commonly named after constellations. Instead, they are usually designated with letters such as M, NGC, IC, which stand for Messier Catalog, New General Catalog of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars, and Index Catalog, respectively. For prominent DSOs, there are sometimes more common names used. For example, M42 in the constellation of Orion is often referred to as the Orion Nebula, and M45 located in the ancient Chinese asterism of the Pleiades is called the Pleiades star cluster.</p>

    <p>In modern constellations, 50 of them evolved from the constellations cataloged by Ptolemy, 12 were named by Johann Bayer in 1603, 7 were named by John Flamsteed in 1690, and 14 were named by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille in 1763. By the year 1922, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) decided to divide the entire sky into 88 constellations and established the Third Committee led by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte (IAU Commission 3); in 1930, the IAU officially defined the boundaries of these constellations. Since then, any star (except the Sun), nebula, or galaxy precisely belongs to a specific constellation.</p>
    <p>In the modern 88 constellations, the brightest constellation is Southern Cross; the constellation with the most visible stars is Centaurus, with over 101 stars brighter than magnitude 6; the largest constellation by area is Hydra, covering 1302.844 square degrees, which is 3.158% of the entire sky; while the smallest constellation, Southern Cross, covers only 68.447 square degrees. Serpens is the only discontinuous constellation, divided into two parts, Serpens Caput and Serpens Cauda, by the constellation Ophiuchus.</p>

        data-text="MORE">Ptolemaic Constellations</a></h2>
    <p>The internationally recognized constellations today are based on the 48 constellations cataloged in the 2nd century CE by Ptolemy in his "Almagest." These 48 constellations are known as the Ptolemaic constellations. Except for Argo Navis, which was divided into Carina, Puppis, and Vela by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille, all other constellations are retained in modern astronomy. The Ptolemaic constellations primarily inherited star charts from the 2nd century BCE Greek astronomer Hipparchus and also referenced observational records from Babylon dating back to between the 8th and 2nd centuries BCE.</p>

    <h2>Modern 88 Constellations</h2>
    <p>The number of constellations continued to increase later on, mainly to fill the gaps between the Ptolemaic constellations (as ancient Greeks believed that there were dim areas between the brighter constellations). Another reason was that as European explorers ventured southward, they could see previously unseen portions of the night sky. Therefore, new constellations were added to fill the southern skies. Removing Argo Navis from the aforementioned 48 Ptolemaic constellations, along with the addition of the following 41 newer constellations, constitutes the modern 88 constellations.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Vespucci and Cornelius, early 16th century:Crux · Triangulum Australe</li>
      <li>Vopel，1536： Coma Berenices</li>
      <li>Kaese and Hautmann，1596： Apus · Chamaeleon · Dorado · Grus · Hydrus · Indus · Musca · Pavo · Phoenix · Tucana · Volans</li>
      <li>Procyon，1613： Camelopardalis · Columba · Monoceros</li>

    </ul>
    <p>Among them, 29 constellations are located north of the celestial equator, 46 are located south of the celestial equator, and 13 constellations span both sides of the celestial equator.</p>
